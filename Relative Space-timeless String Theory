Abstract
This theory suggsets that energy and the expansion of the universe can be explained with Space-Timeless String Theory  https://github.com/cometeric/Space-timeless-String-/blob/main/Space-timeless%20String%20Theory

Introduction
In the original theory it only mentions that the strings in String Theory could also create space and time but now I have got the idea it creates energy and the expansion of the universe.

The theory itself
Energy might be created by the vibrations of the strings speeding up which then produces energy, as the vibrations speeds up the universe gets more space (the expansion of the universe), then sincs its speeding up the universes expansion is accelerating (the accelerating expansion of the universe).
